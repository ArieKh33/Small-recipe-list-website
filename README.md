## Hello everyone

This was originally a smaller school project where you had to make a website with foodblogs which blog each would containunique tags.
But now I am changing it to be a website with food with short descriptions on how to make them.
It is still in it's early stages but will be updated regurerly to practise new methods and techniques.

The endgoal from this program is to learn how to manage a database the best way through trial and error, any comments or advice on the code is always heavily appreciated.

It uses:  
    1. PHP 8.2.1.2  
    2. HTML5/CSS3  
    3. Bootstrap v5.3  

This can be found on my github at: https://github.com/ArieKh33
